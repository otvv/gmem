# :brain: `gmem`
simple memory reading/writing library for linux

***

`gmem` has multiple language support, such as `C++`, `C#` and even `JavaScript`! (look [here](https://github.com/otvv/fmemory) for more info on it). 

You can see all available versions of `gmem`, by using the branch switcher in the repo or going into the _"Pull requests"_ tab.

More programming languages support is already planned. (`Python` and `C` for now, but feel free to contribute with the language of your choice!)

`gmem` can work with Proton/Wine processes too! I've tested `gmem` with some games such as `Apex Legends`, `CS:GO` (Windows version through wine), `GTA V` and many more.
